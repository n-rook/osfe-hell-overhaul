# Hell Overhaul

This mod is designed to spruce up the later hell passes in One Step From Eden! Currently, the later hell passes increase rapidly in difficulty and affect the balance of the game in odd ways.

This mod is recommended for any player who has unlocked Hell Pass 13. It doesn't change anything before HP11, so there's no reason to play it if you aren't playing on that difficulty yet.

This mod is still in development; I haven't uploaded it to the Steam Workshop yet, because I haven't tested it enough to be sure it won't break things horribly.

## Changes

### 11
The new Hell Pass 11 replaces the existing one. Instead of all hostages turning evil, it adds an evil hostage to any battle zone that doesn't have one already. Hostages show up in half of all battle zones, so this keeps a similar number of evil hostages in the game while preserving all the good ones. The intent here is to preserve the fun puzzle of keeping hostages around in battles.

### 13
The new Hell Pass 13 just increases the tier to 3, making a more gradual increase in difficulty.

### 14
This one makes enemies attack more quickly in crowded rooms. In the base game, more enemies, structures and minions in a single room cause the enemies to pause for longer between attacks. In order to make hallway fights harder and more engaging, this effect is removed. 

### 15
15 increases the number of removes required to remove a pact to 3. Removing pacts is very strong, so I'd like to force players to actually take and survive the pacts instead if they want bonuses.

I may in the future change this down to 2 removes, or change it to 2 removes and get rid of the free remove at the start of the run.

### 16
16 reduces effective luck when receiving spells, artifacts and so on by 10. It doesn't impact enemy generation. You'll still be richer than in the normal game.

### 17
17 makes shields less effective; 10% of damage to shields is done to health as well after this. This effect can't kill the player (if you have 1 hp and take 100 shielded damage, you won't die). The intent is to reward careful play even when shields are engaged.

This does apply to self-damage, but Corset is really good even if you lose 4 health by casting it.

### 18
18 increases boss tiers further, but less than the old Hell Pass 13 did. On this tier, the bosses are:

Zone 1: tier 3
Zone 2: tier 4
Zone 3: tier 5
Zone 4: tier 5
Zone 5: tier 6
Zone 6: tier 6
Zone 7: tier 7

The intent is to make the early game less punishing while still forcing the player to fight tough bosses later. The faulty shields also make boss fights harder, so I don't want them to be too punishing.

### Things I'd like to work on in the future

The new HP11 doubles the number of hostages in the game, though half of them are evil, so the already top-tier Soul Food becomes even stronger. This isn't great, but I don't really want to nerf just one artifact in this mod.
