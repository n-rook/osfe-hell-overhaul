# Hell Overhaul

This mod is designed to spruce up the later hell passes in One Step From Eden! Currently, the later hell passes increase rapidly in difficulty and affect the balance of the game in odd ways.

This mod is recommended for any player who has unlocked Hell Pass 13. It doesn't change anything before then, so there's no reason to play it if you aren't playing on that difficulty yet.

This mod is still in development; I haven't uploaded it to the Steam Workshop yet, because I haven't tested it enough to be sure it won't break things horribly.

## Changes

### 13
The new Hell Pass 13 just increases the tier to 3, making a more gradual increase in difficulty.

### 14
This one makes enemies attack more quickly in crowded rooms. In the base game, more enemies, structures and minions in a single room cause the enemies to pause for longer between attacks; [see the wiki for details](https://onestepfromeden.gamepedia.com/Enemies#Stagger). In order to make hallway fights harder and more engaging, the impact of these delays is significantly reduced; "real enemies" increase the delay by only 10%, and structures and minions have no impact at all.

This makes the starts of fights extremely harsh, so in addition to this change, enemy delay is increased significantly at the immediate start of a room (within the first 3 seconds). This means you have a few seconds to get your bearings.

### 15
15 increases the number of removes required to remove a pact to 3. Removing pacts is very strong, so I'd like to force players to actually take and survive the pacts if they want bonuses.

I may in the future change this down to 2 removes, or change it to 2 removes and get rid of the free remove at the start of the run.

### 16
16 reduces effective luck when receiving spells, artifacts and so on by 10. It doesn't impact enemy generation. You'll still be richer than in the normal game.

### 17
17 makes shields less effective; 10% of damage to shields is done to health as well after this. This effect can't kill the player (if you have 1 hp and take 100 shielded damage, you won't die). The intent is to reward careful play even when shields are engaged.

This does apply to self-damage, but Corset is really good even if you lose 4 health by casting it.

### 18
18 increases boss tiers further, but less than the old Hell Pass 13 did. On this tier, the bosses are:

3 4 5 5 6 6 7

For comparison, the base game's highest difficulties are:

4 5 5 6 6 7 7

So this difficulty has lower-tier bosses, especially in the first two zones.

The intent is to make the early game less punishing while still forcing the player to fight tough bosses later. The faulty shields also make boss fights harder, so I don't want them to be too punishing.

### 19
19 makes mana regen half as effective, but grants 0.5 regen initially to offset this penalty.

This does make alternate sources of mana regen more attractive; characters like Teardown Hazel will actually start with more mana than they normally do.

### 20
Good luck.

Pinch, Transfuse and Corset don't trigger the effect, but since they do still respect your current stats, you may still want to stay away from them.

### Bugs and design issues

Currently the HP20 effect isn't preserved across save files. If you take advantage of this, you're cheating not only the game, but yourself.

HP19 is hard on effects that spend mana but give you a mana regen buff in exchange. For example, Terra's Break loadout gets part of the price of breaking tiles refunded with its artifact, but HP19 makes the refund less. This is an unintended consequence, though I'm still thinking about how to fix it.
